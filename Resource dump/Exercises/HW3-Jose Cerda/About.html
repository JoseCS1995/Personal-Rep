    <h1>About Goober.INC</h1>
    <p class="center">If you made it this far then you must be a VIP. Welcome to nothing. The goober is a multi faceted
        company
        that<br>
        deals with many invisibles. Its main goal is to be nothing, while doing nothing and achieving absolutely<br>
        nothing. The goober short for goobs heh is most noticed for nothing. We are undercover, word of mouth, dried
        out<br>
        water fountain type of business. With us your information will maybe be in the clouds, but what we can
        promise<br>
        you is that it will be nothing. Honestly how did you find us? my promise as founder and company owner is that
        I<br>
        will keep nothing. Nope. Nada. I offer goods and services to people like you who want a full lotta nothing</p>
